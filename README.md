# CNet-v2
The second (and hopefully better) version of a library made purely in C for creating and training Artificial Neural Networks.<br>
I will be updating this readme file with necessary explanations and some small snippets of theory whenever necessary.<br>
Feedbacks and suggestions are highly appreciated :) <br>
